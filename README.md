##### Problem: UPenn's CIS 198 "Homework 2: A Mediocre Binary Search Tree"

* [Here is the link to that homework description.](https://github.com/cis198-2016s/homework/tree/master/hw02)
  You can grab their starter code, but you won't be happy. 

* I want an implementation more-or-less along the lines they describe.  I.e.,
  + the basic data type definitions
  + a `new` function
  + a `search` function
  + a `insert` function

* Expect trouble.

* [Here is an implementation of a binary search tree along somewhat different lines](https://gist.github.com/aidanhs/5ac9088ca0f6bdd4a370).
  Please borrow ideas from here.
  
* Have a go at this over the weekend and we'll have a debugging session in Monday's class.
